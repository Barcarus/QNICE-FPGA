Version 1.1  December, 30 2015
==============================

By default, version 1.1 behaves like version 1.0, i.e. input/output is done
via UART, 8-N-1, 9.600 baud, RTS/CTS. But from version 1.1 on, you can now
route the input via a PS/2 keyboard and the output via a 640x480 VGA
monitor (80x40 characters):

* PS/2 keyboard support: enable via SW0
* VGA support: enable via SW1

Version 1.0  August, 30 2015
============================

Classic "Environment 1" (aka env1), inspired by the classic
QNICE/A evaluation board environment. Features:

* the original address layout: lower 32kB are ROM, upper 32kB are RAM
* 16bit words stored at each address word
* 256 registers
* memory mapped IO beginning at 0xFF00
* 4 TIL-311 displays at 0xFF10:
  0xFF10 is the value to be displayed
  0xFF11 lower 4 bit are a display bit mask
* Serial interface 8-N-1, 9.600 baud, RTS/CTS beginning at FF20:
  0xFF21 status register
  0xFF22 read register
  0xFF23 write register      

The package contains a working monitor application (version 0.2) including
the mandelbrot demo application.

Furtheron, the assembler and the emulator are included.
