Version x.y    May, xx 2016
===========================

* CPU: Significant speed improvement by removing old tristate driver
* CPU: Fixed a bug that prevented things like CMP 0x00AA, 0x00FF or
  things OR @R0++, @R0, i.e. situations, where both operands perform an
  indirect access, where the source and destination operands are identical
  and where the  source operand is post-incremented.
* ALU: Fixed CMP opcode behaviour: using the N flag it now treats the
  operands as unsigned and using the V flag it treats them as signed.
* ALU: Fixed V flag CPU bug (AND, OR, XOR)
* CYCLE COUNTER: Added.
* DEBUG MODE: If switch #2 is ON, then the LEDs are showing the current
  address bus value in real-time and on HALT the TIL shows the address
  of the executed HALT command.
* ASSEMBLER: Is able to handle labels on separate lines, improved error
  handling, CMP allows a constant as second operand
* EMULATOR: Fixed CMP opcode behaviour (see above), fixed similar CPU bug
  as described above. Outputs address of HALT instruction.
* DOCUMENTATION: Added a programming card

Version 1.21   February, 13 2016
================================

* Fixed predecrement CPU bug
* Q-TRIS V1.0: Tetris clone and first game ever programmed for Q-NICE.
  Needs VGA and keyboard. Located in demos/q-tris.asm, starts at 0x8000 when
  being run via the monitor. Additionally, there is a special stand-alone
  autostart bitstream for the Digilent Nexys 4 DDR in dist_kit/q-tris.bit

Version 1.2  January, 10 2016
=============================

* UART: 115.200 baud, 8-N-1, CTS from now on
* VGA: now supports hardware scrolling and the lat9w-12 font, which supports
  besides the U.S. english charset also the German charset.
* MONITOR: system call table, supports scrolling on VGA using CTRL+F(orward)
  and CTRL+B(backward) and PgUp/PgDn as well as the cursor keys
* KEYBOARD: support for US and German keyboard locales and support
  for special keys like cursor keys, page-up/down, etc.
* HALT LED implemented as LED #15
* PORE system implemented. Most notably, this leads to not needing to
  press the reset-button after startup. Additionally, a reset message is
  displayed.
* ASSEMBLER: bugfixes and .DW now supports .EQUs and labels as arguments

Version 1.1  December, 30 2015
==============================

By default, version 1.1 behaves like version 1.0, i.e. input/output is done
via UART, 8-N-1, 9.600 baud, RTS/CTS. But from version 1.1 on, you can now
route the input via a PS/2 keyboard and the output via a 640x480 VGA
monitor (80x40 characters):

* PS/2 keyboard support: enable via SW0
* VGA support: enable via SW1

Version 1.0  August, 30 2015
============================

Classic "Environment 1" (aka env1), inspired by the classic
QNICE/A evaluation board environment. Features:

* the original address layout: lower 32kB are ROM, upper 32kB are RAM
* 16bit words stored at each address word
* 256 registers
* memory mapped IO beginning at 0xFF00
* 4 TIL-311 displays at 0xFF10:
  0xFF10 is the value to be displayed
  0xFF11 lower 4 bit are a display bit mask
* Serial interface 8-N-1, 9.600 baud, RTS/CTS beginning at FF20:
  0xFF21 status register
  0xFF22 read register
  0xFF23 write register      

The package contains a working monitor application (version 0.2) including
the mandelbrot demo application.

Furtheron, the assembler and the emulator are included.
