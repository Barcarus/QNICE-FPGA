Version 1.37   October, 4 2016
==============================

BETA / Work-In-Progess (WIP) Version

Kind of stable version that implements EAE and SD CARD reading for
SD V1 and V2 cards. SDHC and SDXC works only for some cards. As a rule
of thumb: Use SD Cards that are up to 2 GB in size. Format them using FAT32
as described in doc/contraints.txt.

For testing the EAE, use:

    test_programs/eae.asm
    test_programs/32bit-mul.asm

For testing the SD Card and FAT32 capabilities, use

    test_programs/sdcard.asm

and choose option '2' to mount an SD Card as FAT32 and enter an interactive
"terminal" browsing mode.

Version x.y    xxx, x xxxx
==========================

WIP * SD CARD: Hardware capabilities for raw SD CARD reading added. 
WIP * FAT32

* EAE: Extended Arithmetic Element added: This is a 32-bit signed/unsigned
  integer multiplication, division and modulo co-processor. An example of the
  impressive speedup can be seen in the source code comments of
  mandel_perf_test.asm, which shows a speedup of factor 4,5 compared with
  release version 1.3.

Version 1.3    May, 6 2016
==========================

* CPU: Significant speed improvement by removing old tristate driver:
  Evolution can be seen in mandel_perf_test.asm, which is now ~32% faster.
  Q-TRIS was even ~56% faster (now adjusted back to normal speed).
* CPU: Fixed a bug that prevented things like CMP 0x00AA, 0x00FF or things
  like OR @R0++, @R0, i.e. situations, where both operands perform an
  indirect access, where the source and destination operands are identical
  and where the  source operand is post-incremented.
* ALU: Fixed CMP opcode behaviour: using the N flag it now treats the
  operands as unsigned and using the V flag it treats them as signed.
* ALU: Fixed V flag CPU bug (AND, OR, XOR)
* CYCLE COUNTER: Added. Counts clock cycles. Can be used for performance
  testing, as shown in test_programs/mandel_perf_test.asm.
* DEBUG MODE: If switch #2 is ON, then the LEDs are showing the current
  address bus value in real-time and on HALT the TIL shows the address
  of the executed HALT command.
* ASSEMBLER: Is able to handle labels on separate lines, improved error
  handling, CMP allows a constant as second operand.
* EMULATOR: Fixed CMP opcode behaviour (see above), fixed similar CPU bug
  as described above. Outputs address of HALT instruction. Also emulates
  the new cycle counter (register compatible), but instead of counting
  clock cycles, it is counting instructions.
* DOCUMENTATION: Added a programming card.

Version 1.21   February, 13 2016
================================

* Fixed predecrement CPU bug
* Q-TRIS V1.0: Tetris clone and first game ever programmed for Q-NICE.
  Needs VGA and keyboard. Located in demos/q-tris.asm, starts at 0x8000 when
  being run via the monitor. Additionally, there is a special stand-alone
  autostart bitstream for the Digilent Nexys 4 DDR in dist_kit/q-tris.bit

Version 1.2  January, 10 2016
=============================

* UART: 115.200 baud, 8-N-1, CTS from now on
* VGA: now supports hardware scrolling and the lat9w-12 font, which supports
  besides the U.S. english charset also the German charset.
* MONITOR: system call table, supports scrolling on VGA using CTRL+F(orward)
  and CTRL+B(backward) and PgUp/PgDn as well as the cursor keys
* KEYBOARD: support for US and German keyboard locales and support
  for special keys like cursor keys, page-up/down, etc.
* HALT LED implemented as LED #15
* PORE system implemented. Most notably, this leads to not needing to
  press the reset-button after startup. Additionally, a reset message is
  displayed.
* ASSEMBLER: bugfixes and .DW now supports .EQUs and labels as arguments

Version 1.1  December, 30 2015
==============================

By default, version 1.1 behaves like version 1.0, i.e. input/output is done
via UART, 8-N-1, 9.600 baud, RTS/CTS. But from version 1.1 on, you can now
route the input via a PS/2 keyboard and the output via a 640x480 VGA
monitor (80x40 characters):

* PS/2 keyboard support: enable via SW0
* VGA support: enable via SW1

Version 1.0  August, 30 2015
============================

Classic "Environment 1" (aka env1), inspired by the classic
QNICE/A evaluation board environment. Features:

* the original address layout: lower 32kB are ROM, upper 32kB are RAM
* 16bit words stored at each address word
* 256 registers
* memory mapped IO beginning at 0xFF00
* 4 TIL-311 displays at 0xFF10:
  0xFF10 is the value to be displayed
  0xFF11 lower 4 bit are a display bit mask
* Serial interface 8-N-1, 9.600 baud, RTS/CTS beginning at FF20:
  0xFF21 status register
  0xFF22 read register
  0xFF23 write register      

The package contains a working monitor application (version 0.2) including
the mandelbrot demo application.

Furtheron, the assembler and the emulator are included.
