TODO LIST FOR VGAEMU
====================

When this list is done, then it makes sense to move the VGA emulator from this
branch to the regular development folder and/or even release it:

* Multiple Window sizes (640x480, Doubled, 16:9, ..., even free sizing?)

* Full Screen

* Regular starting/stopping of app (inter thread-communication necessary)

* Emulate all VGA register commands

* Bring the keyboard emulation on the same level, as the existing hardware
  PS2/USB support, including: German umlauts, U.S. keyboard layout, Mac
  keyboard nitty gritties (e.g. < > Â° ^).

Optional:

* Test, if compilation and running works under Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

* Test, if compilation and running works under Windows

* Use sysdef.h also in the main file qnice.c
