TODO NEXT STEPS:

(DONE) 1. Write a testcase for gets_slf in gets_test.c (also add a hexdump
   view for all three testcases)

(DONE) 2. Thoroughly test all three routines including the fringe case CR/SOMETHING
   and check the results (also using the hexdump)

(DONE) 3. Build a new Monitor

(DONE) 4. Use gets_test in the Monitor version to check again all three gets
   routines

(DONE) 5. Extend qmon to support gets_slf and redo ./compile_and_distribute

(DONE) 6. The goal for __read.c is: Have a reasonably large line buffer, e.g.
   2 lines Ã  80 chars = 160 chars. This is the amount, where you can use
   the backspace key. But you can enter larger buffers.
   Testcase: Buffer = 4. Then enter "12345", press BS multiple times, 
   but you cannot go back the 4, i.e. "123" are "set in stone"

(DONE) 7. If the testcase (and others) work: Set the buffer finally to 160 chars.
   
   ==> gets problem solved

8. In conjunction with the solved multi-file-read: this might be worth
   another beta release - or - add some basic file functions to the
   Monitor: browse dir/cd/load file and then this is a kind of final
   beta V1.39

beta 1.39 would be good enough for a release, too. depends on how much time
there is at the day

another idea would be: let the beta 1.39 live for a while, play with it and
only if it really works after some time, release it
