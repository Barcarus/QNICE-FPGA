Constraints of the QNICE-FPGA (env1) design, that should be mentioned,
when writing the documentation:

SD Card:

* MBR partition table
* FAT32 with a 512 byte sector size.
  ATTENTION: FAT16 and others are not supported, you probably need to 
  manually format the SD Card to be sure, that you are running with FAT32.
* Maximum 65.535 files per folder.
* File names are ASCII only (no Unicode).
* MAC USERS: Do not use the GUI version of the disk utility, as you cannot
  control, if the tool creates FAT16 or FAT32. Use the command line
  version of diskutil instead:

  sudo diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 <name> MBRFormat /dev/<devicename>

  Find out <devicename> using "diskutil list". <name> can be chosen
  arbitrarily.

USB Keyboard:

When attaching an USB keyboard, be sure to use one that supports the old
USB boot mode standard. Not all newer keyboards are compatible. These
keyboards are tested and work:

* Cherry KC 1000
* @TODO: Add the name of vaxman's and deft's keyboards

VGA:

The monitor needs to support 640x480 and 640x400 in 60 Hz.
