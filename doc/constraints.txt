Contraints of the QNICE-FPGA (env1) design, that should be mentioned,
when writing the documentation:

SD Card:

* MBR partition table
* only the first partition is recognized
* FAT32 with a 512 byte blocksize (when using a Mac to format: OSX is
  calling FAT32 sometimes just "FAT" or "MS-DOS file system". Do not use
  ExFAT)


USB Keyboard:

When attaching an USB keyboard, be sure to use one that supports the old
USB boot mode standard. Not all newer keyboards are compatible. These
keyboards are tested and work:

* Cherry KC 1000
* @TODO: Add the name of vaxman's and deft's keyboards

VGA:

The monitor needs to support 640x480 and 640x400 in 60 Hz.
