HARDWARE:

* Fix CPU BUG: Pre-decrement of the destination operand does not work,
  if the source operand is used directly. But it works, if the source
  operand is used indirectly. Example:
    this works:         MOVE @R2, @--R0
    this does not work: MOVE R2, @--R0
  The bug will be presumably fixed, by changing
    and Opcode /= opcMOVE
  in vhdl/qnice_cpu.vhd line 401 to
    and (Opcode /= opcMOVE or Dst_Mode = amIndirPreDec) 
  and therefore making it very similar to line 455: The speed optimization
  must be disabled in case of pre-decrement.
  As soon as this is fixed, the fix can be e.g. tested by changing the two
  spots marked with "@TODO" in test_programs/decimal.asm. As soon as
  everything works, the code in this test program and also in demos/q-tris.asm
  needs to be cleaned up accordingly.

* remove ROM and replace by prefilled RAM

* Fix tristate problem that slows down CPU by ~50%

* Improve design to support 100 MHz

* keyboard: remove hardcoded hardcoded 18000

* Add a timer with 0,1us Resolution (10 MHz frequency), so that
  we can measure performance (e.g. against the emulator)

* Refactor MMIO for not having so many comperators

* Refactor TIL and TIL Mask to support 8 digits / 32 bits

* Refactor scancode conversion to be more table/ROM like and less
  like a huge array of multiplexers

* Refactor Video RAM: avoid inferring two RAMs for video RAM

* single-step-mode in hardware incl. address/data display on 7-segs

MONITOR and/or STANDARD LIBs:

* Backspace and CTRL-U support in IO$GETS

* Basic mathematical routines * (exists), / (from decimal.asm), % (ditto)

* Decimal converter (from decimal.asm)

* 32 bit arithmetic

* Long term: Floating point support

ASSEMBLER:

* Issue a warning, when defining a label multiple times.

* Issue a warning when doing e.g. CMP R0, 0x20, as this won't work.
  (comparing register or @register with constant).
