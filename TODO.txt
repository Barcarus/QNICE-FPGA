HARDWARE:

* check: is there a CPU bug in the context of the stack like MOVE R8, @--SP?
  maybe just a Fata Morgana, as the monitor works actively with the stack
  but for being on the safe side: see q-tris.asm and search @MH CHECK SUSPECT

* remove ROM and replace by prefilled RAM

* Improve design to support 100 MHz

* Fix tristate problem that slows down CPU by ~50%

* keyboard: remove hardcoded hardcoded 18000

* Add a timer with 0,1us Resolution (10 MHz frequency), so that
  we can measure performance (e.g. against the emulator)

* Refactor MMIO for not having so many comperators

* Refactor TIL and TIL Mask to support 8 digits / 32 bits

* Refactor scancode conversion to be more table/ROM like and less
  like a huge array of multiplexers

* Refactor Video RAM: avoid inferring two RAMs for video RAM

* single-step-mode in hardware incl. address/data display on 7-segs

MONITOR and/or STANDARD LIBs:

* Backspace and CTRL-U support in IO$GETS

* Basic mathematical routines * (exists), /, %

* 32 bit arithmetic

* Long term: Floating point support

ASSEMBLER:

* Issue a warning, when defining a label multiple times.
