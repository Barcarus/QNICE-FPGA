HARDWARE:

* CPU BUG: Pre-decrement does not always seem to work. An example of the
  problem can be found in test_programs/decimal.asm at the two spots marked
  with "@TODO". After fixing this, correct the source of the test_program
  and of demos/q-tris.asm

* remove ROM and replace by prefilled RAM

* Improve design to support 100 MHz

* Fix tristate problem that slows down CPU by ~50%

* keyboard: remove hardcoded hardcoded 18000

* Add a timer with 0,1us Resolution (10 MHz frequency), so that
  we can measure performance (e.g. against the emulator)

* Refactor MMIO for not having so many comperators

* Refactor TIL and TIL Mask to support 8 digits / 32 bits

* Refactor scancode conversion to be more table/ROM like and less
  like a huge array of multiplexers

* Refactor Video RAM: avoid inferring two RAMs for video RAM

* single-step-mode in hardware incl. address/data display on 7-segs

MONITOR and/or STANDARD LIBs:

* Backspace and CTRL-U support in IO$GETS

* Basic mathematical routines * (exists), /, %

* 32 bit arithmetic

* Long term: Floating point support

ASSEMBLER:

* Issue a warning, when defining a label multiple times.

* Issue a warning when doing e.g. CMP R0, 0x20, as this won't work.
  (comparing register or @register with constant).
