HARDWARE:

* fix the supposed "rsub after rbra" cpu bug
  (can e.g. be observed after mandel.asm did run or when "the xor's" are
  removed from the IO$GETCHAR routine)

* remove ROM and replace by prefilled RAM

* Improve design to support 100 MHz

* Fix tristate problem that slows down CPU by ~50%

* Extend FF13 to be write-able to switch to DE keyboard layout

* keyboard: remove hardcoded debounce "8" and hardcoded 18000

* HALT-LED

* UART address and register decoding in MMIO

* single-step-mode in hardware incl. address/data display on 7-segs

* 115k baud problem (redo FIFOs in UART?)

ASSEMBLER:

* allow the usage of a single quote like this: ; ... this won't work ...

MONITOR:

* use hardware clear screen

* enhance sysdef.asm to mirror the actual vga registers, particularly the
  new/enhanced meaning of the status/control register
