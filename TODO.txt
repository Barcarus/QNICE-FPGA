HARDWARE:

* remove ROM and replace by prefilled RAM

* Improve design to support 100 MHz

* Fix tristate problem that slows down CPU by ~50%

* keyboard: remove hardcoded hardcoded 18000

* Add a timer with 0,1us Resolution (10 MHz frequency), so that
  we can measure performance (e.g. against the emulator)

* Refactor MMIO for not having so many comperators

* Refactor TIL and TIL Mask to support 8 digits / 32 bits

* Refactor scancode conversion to be more table/ROM like and less
  like a huge array of multiplexers

* Refactor Video RAM: avoid inferring two RAMs for video RAM

* single-step-mode in hardware incl. address/data display on 7-segs

SOFTWARE:

* Backspace and CTRL-U support in IO$GETS

* Basic mathematical routines * (exists), /, %

* 32 bit arithmetic

* Long term: Floating point support
